= Payara Server tools in VS Code
:ordinal: 1

Using the Payara Tools VS Code extension, you can integrate Payara Server within the VS Code IDE to start, stop and manage applications deployed to Payara Server. The extension also allows you to use the hotdeploy and autodeploy features for improving developer efficiency.

IMPORTANT: To add Payara Server to VSCode, the JAVA_HOME environment variable and the PATH system variable must be set.

[[managing-server]]
== Managing Payara Server from VS Code

Once Payara Server is added to VS Code it can be found under the Payara Servers explorer panel with the configured name. Right-clicking on the server lets you perform any of the following actions:

* Start, restart or stop the server
* Start debugging the server
* Rename or remove the server
* Open admin console
* Open server log
* Open server domain.xml config
* Update admin credentials
* Update JDK path

[[manage-applications]]
== Magaging Applications on Payara Server

=== Deploying Applications

An application can be deployed to Payara Server easily though VS Code. Applications can be deployed via either of the following two methods

Right-click on the application and select *Run on Payara Server* to deploy the application:

[[undeploy-applications]]
=== Undeploying Applications
Deployed applications can be opened in the browser, undeployed or disabled by right-clicking on the application in the *Payara Servers* interface:

== Deploy Application to Payara Server Docker Instance

The Payara Server tools in the VS Code extension includes Docker integration, making it seamless to deploy exploded Jakarta applications to a Payara Server instance running within a local Docker container. To take advantage of this feature, follow the steps below:

* Register a new Payara Server instance by performing the following:
    ** Open the command pallet using *Ctrl + Shift + P*, type *Payara* and select the *Add Payara Server* option.
    ** Select Remote Domain.
    ** For Docker integration, choose the "Docker" type and provide the HOST_PATH (e.g., D:/test) and CONTAINER_PATH (e.g., /mnt/test) mapping details. This mapping should align with the exploded application path or parent path of exploded application.
    ** Choose a name for the server.
    ** Enter the domain name, host name, and necessary credentials.
* Run the Payara Server Docker container using the following command:
`docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 -p 9009:9009 -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH  payara/server-full:latest`
Replace HOST_PATH with the actual host path and CONTAINER_PATH with the desired container path. The HOST_PATH points to the location on your host machine, and CONTAINER_PATH is the corresponding location inside the container.
* Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.


== Deploy Application to Payara Server WSL Instance

Another noteworthy feature is the integration of the Payara Server tools with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This integration empowers developers to manage and deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within WSL. Here's how you can make use of this feature:

* Start the Payara Server instance within WSL:

    ** Run the following command to start the server:
        `./asadmin start-domain`
    ** Set a password for the admin user:
        `./asadmin change-admin-password`
    ** Enable secure admin:
        `./asadmin enable-secure-admin`
    ** Restart the Payara Server domain:
        `./asadmin restart-domain`
    ** Fetch the IP address of WSL instance using the command `hostname -I` and enter it in the `host name` field in VSCode.

* Register the WSL-based Payara Server instance in VS Code:

    ** Open the command pallet using *Ctrl + Shift + P*, type *Payara* and select the *Add Payara Server* option.
    ** Select Remote Domain.
    ** For WSL integration, choose the "WSL" instance type.
    ** Choose a name for the server.
    ** Enter the domain name, host name (fetched via the command `hostname -I` in WSL instance), and necessary credentials.

* Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.

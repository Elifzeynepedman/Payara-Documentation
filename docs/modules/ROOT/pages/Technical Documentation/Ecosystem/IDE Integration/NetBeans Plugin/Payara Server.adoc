= Payara Server NetBeans Plugin
:ordinal: 1

The Netbeans IDE has built-in integration with Payara Server and allows you to easily perform the following tasks:

- Start and stop the Payara Server from within the IDE
- Define the Java runtime to be used by Payara Server
- Deploy an application from within the IDE
- Auto Publish & Hot Deploy your application

== Adding Payara Server to NetBeans

. Go to *Tools - Servers*.
. Click *Add Server*.
. Select *Payara Server* and choose a name for the server.
. Select the location of the `payara` directory of your Payara Server installation. If the DAS is on another machine then check the *Remote Domain* box, otherwise select *Local Domain*. Read and accept the license agreement.
. Enter the following details for the domain:
* Domain -> This is the name of the domain you want to use. By default this is `*domain1*`.
* Host -> This is the hostname that the server will be listening on. By default this is `*localhost*`.
* DAS Port -> This is the port that the `*admin-listener*` listens on. By default this is `*4848*`.
* HTTP Port -> This is the port that the application will be hosted on. By default this is `*8080*`.
* Target -> This is the name of the node that the application will be getting deployed to. This can be left blank if it is a local installation.
* Username -> This is the admin username for Payara Server. By default this is `*admin*`.
* Password -> This is the admin password for Payara Server. By default this is blank.

== Managing Payara Server from NetBeans

Management of Payara Server from NetBeans is done through the *Services* tab.

Once Payara Server is added to NetBeans it can be found under *Servers* with the configured name. Right clicking on the server lets you do the following actions:

* Start or stop the server.
* Start debugging the server.
* Open admin console.
* Open server log.

Exploding the server dropdown will list *Applications*, *Resources* and *Web Services*. This allows you to view and manage certain Payara Server configurations, from the NetBeans interface.

*Example:* Under `Resources -> JDBC -> Connection Pools -> H2Pool (right click) -> Properties` you can view and modify connection pool properties for the H2Pool.

== Deploying Applications to Payara Server

An application can be deployed and undeployed easily from within NetBeans. First, the application run settings need to be configured to use Payara Server. Go to *Properties* on a project and then the *Run* section of this window. This menu lists the configuration for deploying the application.

Select the Payara Server you have configured. You can also select a context path for the application to be deployed to, as well as NetBeans behaviour when deploying.

Deploying to Payara Server now only requires running the application like any other NetBeans project. Once it's deployed, the *Services* view will then display the application under *Payara Server*, where you can undeploy, enable, disable and view the application in the browser.

== Deploy Application to Payara Server Docker Instance

The Payara Server tools in the Apache NetBeans includes Docker integration, making it seamless to deploy exploded Jakarta applications to a Payara Server instance running within a local Docker container. To take advantage of this feature, follow the steps below:

* Open Apache NetBeans and navigate to the Services tab.
* Register a new Payara Server instance by performing the following:
    ** Click on the "Add Server" button.
    ** Select the "Remote Domain" option.
    ** Browse and locate the Payara Server installation directory with the same version as the one running in the Docker container.
    ** Enter the domain name, host, and necessary credentials.
    ** For Docker integration, choose the "Docker Volume" option and provide the HOST_PATH (e.g., D:/test) and CONTAINER_PATH (e.g., /mnt/test) mapping details. This mapping should align with the exploded application path or parent path of exploded application.
* Run the Payara Server Docker container using the following command:
`docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 -p 9009:9009 -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH  payara/server-full:latest`
Replace HOST_PATH with the actual host path and CONTAINER_PATH with the desired container path. The HOST_PATH points to the location on your host machine, and CONTAINER_PATH is the corresponding location inside the container.
* Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.

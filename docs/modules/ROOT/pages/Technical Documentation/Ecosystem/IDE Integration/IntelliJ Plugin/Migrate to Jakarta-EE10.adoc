After choosing the `Destination Directory`, a confirmation message will appear indicating that the project is being generated.

IMPORTANT: You can see the output of the generation process in the IntelliJ console.

The Maven plugin that executes the transformation process will print its output to the IDE's console:

After the creation, a maven `BUILD SUCCESS` message should be logged in the IDE's console.

The `New Project` called `demo-JakartaEE10` is opened on a new IntelliJ instance which loads the project from the `Destination Directory`.

IMPORTANT: You can see the output of the generation process in the IntelliJ console.

The output of the Maven plugin that executes the transformation code can be reviewed in the IDE's console:

After the new file is created, a `BUILD SUCCESS` message from the Maven plugin will be logged in the IDE's console.

The new file will be located in the chosen destination package.

NOTE: When the whole project is migrated, the plugin adds `jakartaEE10` at the end of the project name. In our example, `demo-JakartaEE10` project was created from `demo` project. In case of a file migration, a jakartaee10 package will be created in the destination package.

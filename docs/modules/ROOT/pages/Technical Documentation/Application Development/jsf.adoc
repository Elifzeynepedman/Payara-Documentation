= Using Jakarta Faces

This chapter describes how to use the Jakarta Faces (JSF) API.

[[introducing-jakarta-faces]]
== Introducing Jakarta Faces

Jakarta Faces is a server-side component framework for creating diverse Java technologyâ€“based web applications for browser-focused environments.

Jakarta Faces consists of the following:

* An API for representing components and managing their state; handling events, server-side validation, and data conversion; defining page navigation; supporting internationalization and accessibility

* Tag library sets for adding components to web pages and for linking components to server-side objects.

Jakarta Faces provides a well-defined programming model and various *tag libraries*. These tag libraries contain *tag handlers* that implement component tags. These features significantly ease the burden of creating and maintaining web applications with server-side user interfaces.

[[jakarta-faces-applications]]
=== Jakarta Faces Applications

The functionality provided by a Jakarta Faces application is similar to that of any other Java web-based application. A typical Jakarta Faces application includes the following parts.

* A set of web pages in which components are rendered at runtime.
* A set of tags to add components to the web page.
* A set of managed Java beans, which are lightweight, container-managed objects (POJOs).
** In a Jakarta Faces application, managed beans usually serve as *backing beans*, which define properties to store data and methods and event handlers for UI components on a page.
* A web deployment descriptor (`web.xml`).
* _(Optional)_ One or more application configuration resource files, such as a `faces-config.xml` file, which can be used to define page navigation rules and provide further customization options for the application.
* _(Optional)_ A set of custom objects, which can include custom components, validators, converters, or listeners.
* _(Optional)_ A set of custom tags for representing custom or complex objects on the page.

== Configurable JSF options

This section documents specific configuration settings that are not available in the standard deployment descriptors or configuration files described above as part of the Jakarta Faces API.

[[parallel-initialization]]
=== Parallel Initialization

It is possible to specify a Payara Platform specific JSF context parameter in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor, named `fish.payara.faces.enableParallelInit` to provide parallel initialization benefits to the application in question.

[[parallel-initialization-usage]]
==== Usage

When the `fish.payara.faces.enableParallelInit` context parameter is set to `true` some of the internal initialisation of Mojarra (the JSF implementation Payara Server uses) is performed in parallel.

To this effect, this the platform fork/join thread pool is used, which is the same pool used for processing JDK 8 Streams in parallel.

[[parallel-initialization-example]]
==== Example

Here's an example that sets the option to `true` in `web.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>fish.payara.faces.enableParallelInit</param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
----

The `fish.payara.faces.enableParallelInit` context parameter can also be combined with the `com.sun.faces.enableThreading` parameter:

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>com.sun.faces.enableThreading</param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
----

This is an existing Mojarra-specific parameter to also enable parallel initialisation, but in a slightly earlier stage of the initialisation process.

IMPORTANT: As a Payara Platform specific implementation this will use the default Platform Concurrency executor if there is one, if not it will create a single use executor with 5 threads.

== Description

The phone home data is presently used to gather usage statistics about the corresponding distribution, such as how long users typically run instances, and what versions they use.
The phone home service is enabled by default when starting a Payara Server or Payara Micro and can be disabled by using this command. Make sure to restart Payara Server for the changes to take effect.

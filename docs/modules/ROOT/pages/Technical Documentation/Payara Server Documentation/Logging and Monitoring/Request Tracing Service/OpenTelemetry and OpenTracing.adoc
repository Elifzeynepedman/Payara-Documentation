= OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing support

Payara Server and Payara Micro natively support OpenTelemetry APIs as well as export of traces over OTLP protocol.
Natively in this context means, that deployment of an OpenTelemetry Agent is not necessary and may lead to duplicate traces.

All OpenTracing support in Payara products is done by means of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/migration/opentracing[OpenTracing Compatibility Layer].

Payara Server and Payara Micro satisfy requirements of both link:{mpOpenTracingSpecUrl}[MicroProfile OpenTracing {mpOpenTracingVersion}] and link:{mpTelemetrySpecUrl}[MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing {mpTelemetryVersion}] provided appropriate <<span-convention-settings>> are applied.

Implementation only covers the tracing aspect of OpenTelemetry, no metrics or logs are provided by default.
Manual instrumentation is needed to enable these.

== Enabling OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is enabled for a particular application when:

* It defines MicroProfile config property `otel.sdk.disabled` with value of `false` as defined by MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing
* Request Tracing Service is enabled
* System property `otel.sdk.disabled` is set to `false`
* Environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` is set to `false`

[[configuring-opentelemetry]]
== Configuring OpenTelemetry

When OpenTelemetry is enabled it proceeds to configure OpenTelemetry components by means of link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/v{openTelemetryVersion}/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md[autoconfiguration], using the application's MicroProfile Config properties prefixed with `otel.` first, but also falling back to system properties and environment variables as described in the linked documentation.

If the configured component does not ship with Payara distribution, it can be added as a server or application library as described in <<using-additional-components>>.

=== Default Settings

With no other configuration properties specified OpenTelemetry components will:

* Accept and propagate trace headers and baggage according to W3C recommendations https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[Trace Context] and https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/[Baggage]
* Export traces via OTLP protocol to `http://localhost:4317`
* Respect parent trace's sampling decision and always sample local root traces (sampler setting `parentbased_always_on`)
* Will not export metrics or logs

To easily receive traces in default configuration run the following Jaeger container and then access its UI at port `16686`:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --name jaeger \
   -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
   -p 16686:16686 \
   -p 4317:4317 \
   -p 4318:4318 \ 
   jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest

[[span-convention-settings]]
=== Span Convention Settings

In order to improve consistency among products our implementation offers several strategies of naming and tagging spans of Jakarta REST client and server calls.
These are configured by specifying the MicroProfile Config property `payara.telemetry.span-convention` for your application.
The following values are accepted:

* `opentelemetry` follows convention prescribed by https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/[OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for HTTP spans] (default setting)
* `opentracing-http-path` satisfies MicroProfile OpenTracing setting for Operation Name Provider `http-path`
* `opentracing-class-method` corresponds to MicroProfile OpenTracing setting for Operation Name Provider `class-method`
* `microprofile-telemetry` satisfies span naming as tested by the MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing TCK

==== Span Name Examples

Let's assume `GET` request made to `/app/rest/resource/method`, where

* `/app` is application context root
* `/rest` is `@ApplicationPath` of Jakarta REST
* `/resource` is `@Path` annotation of class `example.Resource`
* `/method` is `@Path` annotation of method `restMethod`

The following span names will be created for this request for different Span Convention settings:

|===
| span-convention setting| Server Span Name

| `opentelemetry` | `GET /app/rest/resource/method`
| `opentracing-class-method` | `GET:example.Resource.restMethod` 
| `opentracing-http-path` | `GET:/resource/method`
| `microprofile-telemetry` | `/app/rest/resource/method`
|===


=== Suppressing Export Warning Message

When the export endpoint is not available in default setting the following error message is logged by logger `io.opentelemetry.exported.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter`:

> Failed to export spans. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to `localhost/127.0.0.1:4317`

If you don't intend to run an OTEL endpoint on localhost or at all you need to configure exporter by means of MP Config Properties, system properties, or environment variables:

* in order to turn off exports set `otel.traces.exporter` to `none`
* in order to set remote endpoint `otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint` to `http://<collector-host>:<port>`

== Manual tracing

In order to fine-tune spans and have better control about their boundaries one can use directly either the OpenTracing or OpenTelemetry APIs.

=== Dependencies

The appropriate versions of APIs are provided by xref:/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Project Management Tools/Maven Bom.adoc[Payara BOM artifact] matching the version of Payara Server or Micro you are using.

Payara Platform provides the following APIs and it is advised to mark them as `provided` dependencies in your application and don't package them with it:

* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-common`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-metrics`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-logs`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api-logs`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-semconv`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-opentracing-shim`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-context`
* `io.opentracing:opentracing-api`
* `io.opentracing:opentracing-noop`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-trace`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-common`
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-common`

            // do work, add information to span

            if (span.isRecording()) {
                // compute expensive events or tags
                // only if the span is being sampled
            }
        } finally {
            span.setStatus(StatusCode.OK);
            span.end();

[[using-additional-components]]
== Using additional components

If your application requires OpenTracing components that are not shipped with Payara Platform, it is possible to either put them in common libraries, or ship them with an application.
Extension components can be even coded directly in the application code.

=== Provider components in library directory

Autoconfiguration can pick up components, which are placed in directory `<domaindir>/lib` for example by means of command `asadmin add-library`.

==== Example: adding export to log

. Download https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-exporter-logging[opentelemetry-exporter-logging.jar]
. Run `asadmin add-library opentelemetry-exporter-logging.jar`
. Use the component by defining `otel.traces.exporter=logging`

=== Provider components in application code

Applications can declare and use their own OpenTelemetry components such as exporters or samplers by writing against https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi/latest/index.html[autoconfiguration SPI] and placing appropriate Service Loader resource in the applicaiton

==== Example: Minimal logging exporter

.src/main/resources/META-INF/services/io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.spi.traces.ConfigurableSpanExporterProvider
[source]
----
example.LogExporter.Provider
----

.src/main/java/example/LogExporter.java
[source,java]
----
public class LogExporter implements SpanExporter {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(LogExporter.class.getName());

    @Override
    public CompletableResultCode export(Collection<SpanData> spans) {
        spans.forEach(s -> LOGGER.info(s.toString()));
        return CompletableResultCode.ofSuccess();
    }

    @Override
    public CompletableResultCode flush() {
        return CompletableResultCode.ofSuccess();
    }

    @Override
    public CompletableResultCode shutdown() {
        return CompletableResultCode.ofSuccess();
    }

    // This is registered as SPI and creates configured exporter
    public static class Provider implements ConfigurableSpanExporterProvider {

        @Override
        public SpanExporter createExporter(ConfigProperties configProperties) {
            return new LogExporter();
        }

        @Override
        public String getName() {
            return "logs";
        }
    }
}

== Relation to Request Tracing Service

All spans created by OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing APIs are passed into Request Tracing Service when they end.
Propagated trace IDs are propagated into Request Tracing Service at the start of spans.

Sampling decisions of Request Tracing service are _not_ taken into account when these traces are created, because Request Tracing Service does tracing decision at the end of span rather than at the beginning.
This means that traces might get exported via OTLP but not passed to the notifiers configured in the Request Tracing Service, because the service might have taken the decision not to sample this particular trace.

Information that server's components put into Request Tracing Service is not available to OpenTelemetry traces, as information does not flow in this direction.
However, more and more parts of Payara Server will gradually switch to using OpenTelemetry API natively and therefore this gap will eventually close.

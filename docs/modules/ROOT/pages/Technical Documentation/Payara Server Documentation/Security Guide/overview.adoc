This security guide provides instructions for configuring and administering basic security concerns in Payara Server.


TIP: Payara Platform Enterprise also provides the link:{enterpriseDocsPageRootUrl}/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Public API/yubikey.html[Yubikey Authentication Mechanism] feature. This allows authentication through a hardware device. This type of authentication removes some need of using credentials and requires authenticating using a physical token in a very secure way.

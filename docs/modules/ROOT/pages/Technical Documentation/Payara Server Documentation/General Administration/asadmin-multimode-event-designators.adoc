= Enable Asadmin CLI Multimode Event Designators


This feature allows the use of **Bash Event Designators** when using Payara Server's Asadmin CLI in multimode.

An Event Designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list, which makes it easy for users to refer and re-use previous asadmin subcommands entries.

IMPORTANT: This feature is disabled by default in Payara Server and has to be enabled first before being used.

WARNING: If this feature is enabled, all occurrences of the `\` character will be escaped and thus, removed before running the corresponding command. You'll have to escape these characters and turn them into `\\` for any commands to be properly parsed.

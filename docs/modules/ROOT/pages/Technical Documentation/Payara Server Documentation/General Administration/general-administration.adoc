[[general-administration]]
= General Administration

This chapter provides instructions for performing general administration tasks in the Payara Server environment by using the `asadmin` command-line utility.

[[using-the-asadmin-utility]]
== Using the `asadmin` Utility

Use the `asadmin` utility to perform administrative tasks for Payara Server from the command line or from a script. You can use this utility instead of the Administration Console interface.

[[path-to-the-asadmin-utility]]
=== Path to the `asadmin` Utility

The `asadmin` utility is located in the `as-install/bin` directory. To run the `asadmin` utility without specifying the path, ensure that this directory is in your path.

[[asadmin-utility-syntax]]
=== `asadmin` Utility Syntax

The syntax for running the `asadmin` utility is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin [asadmin-util-options] [subcommand [subcommand-options] [operands]]
----

The replaceable items in this syntax are described in the subsections that follow.

[[subcommands-of-the-asadmin-utility]]
==== *Subcommands of the `asadmin` Utility*

The subcommand identifies the operation or task that you are performing. Subcommands are case-sensitive. Each subcommand is either a local subcommand or a remote subcommand.

* A local subcommand can be run without a running domain administration server (DAS). However, to run the subcommand and have access to the installation directory and the domain directory, the user must be logged in to the machine that hosts the domain.
* A remote subcommand is always run by connecting to a DAS and running the subcommand there. A running DAS is required.

[[asadmin-utility-options-and-subcommand-options]]
==== *`asadmin` Utility Options and Subcommand Options*

Options control the behavior of the `asadmin` utility and its subcommands. Options are case-sensitive.

The `asadmin` utility has the following types of options:

*`asadmin` utility options*:: These options control the behavior of the `asadmin` utility, not the subcommand.
+
The `asadmin` utility options may precede or follow the subcommand, but `asadmin` utility options after the subcommand are deprecated.
+
All `asadmin` utility options must either precede or follow the subcommand. If `asadmin` utility options are specified both before and after the subcommand, an error occurs.

*Subcommand Options*:: These options control the behavior of the subcommand, not the `asadmin` utility. Subcommand options must follow the subcommand. +

A subcommand option may have the same name as an `asadmin` utility option, but the effects of the two options are different.

Options have a long form and a short form.

* The short form of an option has a single dash (`-`) followed by a single character.
* The long form of an option has two dashes (`--`) followed by an option word.

For example, the short form and the long form of the option for specifying terse output are as follows:

* Short form: `-t`
* Long form: `--terse`

TIP: Most options require argument values, except `Boolean` options, which toggle to enable or disable a feature.

[[operands-of-asadmin-utility-subcommands]]
==== *Operands of `asadmin` Utility Subcommands*

Operands specify the items on which the subcommand is to act. Operands must follow the argument values of subcommand options, and are set off by a space, a tab, or double dashes (`--`). The `asadmin` utility treats anything that follows the subcommand options and their values as an operand.

[[to-run-an-asadmin-utility-subcommand-in-single-mode]]
=== To Run an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand in Single Mode

In single mode, you must type a separate `asadmin` command for each subcommand that you want to use. After the subcommand has run, you are returned to the operating system's command shell. Any `asadmin` utility options must be specified in each separate `asadmin` command that you run.

If you require the same `asadmin` utility options for multiple subcommands, use the `asadmin` utility in multimode.
For more information, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/general-administration.adoc#to-start-a-multimode-session[To Start a Multimode Session].

. In the operating system's command shell, run the `asadmin` utility, specifying the subcommand.
. If necessary, also specify any required `asadmin` utility options, subcommand options, and operands.

==== Example 2-1 Running an asadmin Utility Subcommand in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin list-applications
hello <web>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example runs the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-applications.adoc[`list-applications`] subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the default values for all options are used.

The example shows that the application `hello` is deployed on the local host.

==== Example 2-2 Specifying an asadmin Utility Option With a Subcommand in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications
basic-ezcomp <web>
scrumtoys <web>
ejb31-war <ejb, web>
automatic-timer-ejb <ejb>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example specifies the `--host` `asadmin` utility option with the `list-applications` subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the DAS is running on the host `srvr1.example.com`.

The example shows that the applications `basic-ezcomp`, `scrumtoys`, `ejb31-war`, and `automatic-timer-ejb` are deployed on the host `srvr1.example.com`.

==== Example 2-3 Specifying an `asadmin` Utility Option and a Subcommand Option in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications --type web
basic-ezcomp <web>
scrumtoys <web>
ejb31-war <ejb, web>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example specifies the `--host` `asadmin` utility option and the `--type` subcommand option with the `list-applications` subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the DAS is running on the host `srvr1.example.com` and applications of type `web` are to be listed.

[[to-display-help-information-for-the-asadmin-utility-or-a-subcommand]]
=== To Display Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility or a Subcommand

Payara Server provides help information about the syntax, purpose, and options of the `asadmin` utility and its subcommands.

This help information is also available in the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc[Payara Server Reference Manual].

. If you are displaying help information for a remote subcommand, ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

. Specify the subcommand of interest as the operand of the `help` subcommand. If you run the `help` subcommand without an operand, help information for the `asadmin` utility is displayed.

==== Example 2-4 Displaying Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility

[source,shell]
----
asadmin help
----

This example displays the help information for the `asadmin` utility.

==== Example 2-5 Displaying Help Information for an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand

[source,shell]
----
asadmin help create-jdbc-resource
----

This example displays the help information for the `create-jdbc-resource` subcommand.

To display the available subcommands, use the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-commands.adoc[`list-commands`] subcommand. Local subcommands are displayed before remote subcommands. If the server is not running, only local subcommands are displayed.

[[to-start-a-multimode-session]]
=== To Start a Multimode Session

The `asadmin` utility can be used in multiple command mode, or multimode. In multimode, you run the `asadmin` utility once to start a multimode session.During the session, the `asadmin` utility continues to accept subcommands until you end the session and return to the operating system's command shell.

Any `asadmin` utility options that you set for your multimode session are used for all subsequent subcommands in the session.

NOTE: Starting a multimode session does not require a running DAS.

. Do one of the following:
+
* Run the `asadmin` utility without a subcommand.
* Use the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`] subcommand.

. If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that will apply throughout the multimode session.
. In a multimode session, the `asadmin>` prompt is displayed on the command line. You can now type `asadmin` subcommands at this prompt to administer Payara Server.

==== Example 2-6 Starting a Multimode Session With `asadmin` Utility Options

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --user admin1 --passwordfile pwd.txt multimode
----
This example starts a multimode session in which the `asadmin` utility options `--user` and `--passwordfile` are set for the session.

==== Example 2-7 Starting a Multimode Session by Using the `multimode` Subcommand

[source,shell]
----
asadmin multimode
----
This example uses the `multimode` subcommand to start a multimode session in which the default `asadmin` utility options are used.


The `asadmin>` prompt is displayed on the command line.

==== Example 2-8 Running a Subcommand in a Multimode Session

[source,shell]
----
asadmin
Use "exit" to exit and "help" for online help.

asadmin> list-domains
Name: domain1 Status: Running
Command list-domains executed successfully.
asadmin>
----
This example starts a multimode session and runs the `list-domains` subcommand in the session.

*Starting a Multimode Session From Within an Existing Multimode Session*

You can start a multimode session from within an existing session by
running the `multimode` subcommand from within the existing session.
After you end the second multimode session, you return to your original
multimode session.

[[to-end-a-multimode-session]]
=== To End a Multimode Session

At the `asadmin>` prompt, type one of the following commands or key combinations:

* `exit`
* `quit`
* UNIX and Linux systems: `Ctrl-D`
* Windows systems: `Ctrl-Z`

CAUTION: Do not type `Ctrl-C` to end a multimode session. If a domain or Payara Server instance is started from the multimode session, typing `Ctrl-C` kills the domain or instance process.

You are returned to the operating system's command shell and the `asadmin>` prompt is no longer displayed. If the `asadmin>` prompt is still displayed, you might have opened a multimode session within a multimode session. In this situation, repeat this procedure to end the remaining multimode session.

[[to-run-a-set-of-asadmin-subcommands-from-a-file]]
=== To Run a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File

Running a set of `asadmin` subcommands from a file enables you to automate repetitive tasks.

. Create a plain text file that contains the sequence of subcommands that you want to run.
. Run the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`] subcommand, specifying the file that you created.
+
If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that are required to enable subcommands in the file to run.

==== Example 2-9 Running a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File.

[source,shell]
----
create-domain --portbase 9000 customdomain
start-domain customdomain
list-commands
stop-domain customdomain
delete-domain customdomain
----
This example contains the following:

* A listing of a file that is named `commands_file.txt`, which contains
a sequence of `asadmin` subcommands
* The command to run the subcommands in the file `commands_file.txt`

The `commands_file.txt` file contains the `asadmin` utility subcommands
to perform the following sequence of operations:

. Creating the domain `customdomain`
. Starting the domain `customdomain`
. Listing all available subcommands
. Stopping the domain `customdomain`
. Deleting the domain `customdomain`

This example runs the sequence of subcommands in the `commands_file.txt` file. Because the `--portbase` option is specified for the `create-domain` subcommand in the file, the `--port` `asadmin` utility option must also be set.

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --port 9048 multimode --file commands_file.txt
----

For more information about the subcommands in the preceding example, see the following help pages:

* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-domain.adoc[`create-domain`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/delete-domain.adoc[`delete-domain`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-commands.adoc[`list-commands`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/start-domain.adoc[`start-domain`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/stop-domain.adoc[`stop-domain`]

//TODO - Review if these features are working properly in Payara Server: attach, detach, managed jobs
//Also, update documentation on related commands

[[to-run-asadmin-subcommands-in---detach-mode]]
=== To Run `asadmin` Subcommands in `--detach` Mode

You can use the `--detach` option of the `asadmin` utility to detach `asadmin` subcommands and run them in the background in detach mode.
The `asadmin` `--detach` option is useful for long-running subcommands and enables you to run several independent subcommands from one console or script.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote commands require a running server.
. Detach and run the subcommand by using the `asadmin` `--detach` option.

==== Example 2-10 Using the `--detach` Option in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --detach create-cluster Cluster1
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----
This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in single mode to run the `create-cluster` subcommand.

==== Example 2-11 Using the `--detach` Option in Multimode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-cluster Cluster1 --detach
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----
This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in multimode to run the `create-cluster` subcommand.


Job IDs are assigned to subcommands that are started using the `asadmin` `--detach` option or that contain progress information.
You can use the `list-jobs` subcommand to list jobs and their job IDs, the `attach` subcommand to reattach to a job and view its status, and the `configure-managed-jobs` subcommand to configure how long information about jobs is kept.

==== Example 2-12 Listing Jobs

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> list-jobs
JOB ID     COMMAND           STATE       EXIT CODE TIME OF COMPLETION
1          create-instance    COMPLETED   SUCCESS   2023-02-15 16:16:16 PST
2          deploy            COMPLETED   FAILURE   2023-02-15 18:26:30 PST
Command list-jobs executed successfully
----
This example runs the `list-jobs` subcommand in multimode to list jobs and job information.

==== Example 2-13 Attaching to a Subcommand and Checking Its Status

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> attach 1
Command create-cluster executed with status SUCCESS.
Command attach executed successfully.
----
This example runs the `attach` subcommand in multimode to attach to the `create-cluster` subcommand with a job ID of `1`. If a subcommand is still in progress, the output displays the current status, such as percentage complete.

==== Example 2-14 Configuring Managed Jobs

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> configure-managed-jobs --job-retention-period=36h
Command configure-managed-jobs executed successfully.
----

This example runs the `configure-managed-jobs` subcommand in multimode to set the job retention period to 36 hours. Time periods can be specified in `Hh|Mm|Ss` format for hours, minutes, or seconds.

For the full syntax and options of the subcommands in the preceding examples, see the following help pages:

* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/attach.adoc[`attach`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/configure-managed-jobs.adoc[`configure-managed-jobs`]
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-jobs.adoc[`list-jobs`]

[[using-configuration-modularity]]
== Using Configuration Modularity

With configuration modularity in Payara Server, new modules can be added to Payara Server distributions without modifying the global `domain.xml` configuration file. Default configuration data for modules is stored in the modules themselves, rather than in `domain.xml`, and loaded when needed.

Module configuration elements are stored in `domain.xml` only when the default configuration included in the module is changed or when module configuration elements are added to `domain.xml` using the `create-module-config` subcommand. The `delete-module-config` subcommand removes module configuration elements from `domain.xml`, and the `get-active-module-config` subcommand displays the current active configuration of a module.

[[to-add-the-default-configuration-of-a-module-to-domain.xml]]
=== To Add the Default Configuration of a Module to `domain.xml`

Use the `create-module-config` subcommand to add the default configuration of a module to `domain.xml`.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

[[administering-resources]]
== Administering Resources

This section contains instructions for integrating resources into the Payara Server environment.Information about administering specific resources, such as JDBC, is contained in other chapters.

[[to-add-resources-from-an-xml-file]]
=== To Add Resources From an XML File

Use the `add-resources` subcommand in remote mode to create the resources named in the specified XML file.
The following resources are supported: JDBC connection pool and resource, JMS, JNDI, and JavaMail resources, custom resource, connector resource and work security map, admin object, and resource adapter configuration.

The XML file must reside in the `domain-dir/config` directory. If you specify a relative path or simply provide the name of the XML file, this subcommand will prepend `domain-dir/config` to this operand.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

[[to-list-timers]]
=== To List Timers

The timer service is a persistent and transactional notification service that is provided by the enterprise bean container and is used to schedule notifications or events used by enterprise beans. All enterprise beans except stateful session beans can receive notifications from the timer service.

Persistent timers set by the
service are not destroyed when the server is shut down or restarted.

Use the `list-timers` subcommand in remote mode to list the persistent timers owned by a specific server instance. You can use this information to decide whether to do a timer migration, or to verify that a migration has been completed successfully.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List timers by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-timers.adoc[`list-timers`] subcommand.

[[using-rest-interfaces-to-administer-payara-server]]
== Using REST Interfaces to Administer Payara Server

Payara Server provides representational state transfer (REST) interfaces to enable you to access monitoring and configuration data for Payara Server, including data that is provided by newly installed add-on components.

You can access the Payara Server REST interfaces through client applications such as:

* Web browsers
* http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL]
* http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[GNU Wget]

The implementation of the Payara Server REST interfaces is based on https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey[project Jersey]. Project Jersey is the reference implementation of https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services].

[[using-rest-urls-to-administer-payara-server]]
===  Using REST URLs to Administer Payara Server

Each object in the configuration and monitoring object trees is represented as a REST resource that is accessible through an HTTP uniform resource locator (URL).
Access to REST resources for Payara Server monitoring and configuration data requires a running DAS.

[[rest-urls-to-resources-for-configuration-and-monitoring-objects]]
=== REST URLs to Resources for Configuration and Monitoring Objects

The formats of the URLs to resources that represent objects in the configuration and monitoring object trees are as follows:

* Configuration: `http://host:port/management/domain/path`
* Monitoring: `http://host:port/monitoring/domain/path`

The replaceable items in these URLs are as follows:

host::
  The host where the DAS is running.
port::
  The HTTP port or HTTPS port for administration.
path::
  The path to the object. The path is the dotted name of the object in which each dot (`.`) is replaced with a slash (`/`).
+
NOTE: The path to a Payara Server instance is `servers/server/instance-name`, where instance-name is the name of the instance. For the DAS, instance-name is `server` and the path is `servers/server/server`.

If the URL to a REST resource for Payara Server monitoring or configuration data is opened in a web browser, the browser displays a web page that contains the following information about the resource:

* A list of the attributes of the resource and their values. If the resource represents an object in the configuration tree, these attributes are presented in an HTML form that you can use to update the resource. Attributes of a resource for an object in the monitoring tree are read only.
* A list of hypertext links to the children of the resource. This list of links enables you to traverse the tree that contains the resource and to discover the all resources in the tree.
* A list of hypertext links to resources that represent `asadmin` subcommands for non-CRUD operations on the resource.

The following figure shows the web page for the REST resource for managing a domain.

.*Figure 2-1 Web Page for the REST Resource for Managing a Domain*
image:administration/rest-management.png["REST resource for managing a domain."]

[[rest-urls-for-accessing-the-log-file]]
=== REST URLs for Accessing the Log File

The `server.log` file of the DAS is represented as a child that is named `view-log` of the resource for managing the domain. A child of the resource for the `server.log` file represents the log file details

The formats of the URLs to resources that represent the log file are as follows:

* Log file: `http://host:port/management/domain/view-log`
* Log file details: `http://host:port/monitoring/domain/view-log/details`

The replaceable items in these URLs are as follows:

host::
  The host where the DAS is running.
port::
  The HTTP port or HTTPS port for administration.

You can use the optional `start` parameter in the URL to the resource for the log file to specify the number of characters at the start of the file to skip.

For example, to skip 10,000 characters, specify the URL as `http://localhost:4848/management/domain/view-log?start=10000`. This example assumes that the DAS is running on the local host and uses the default port for administration.

The resource for the log file returns the HTTP header `X-Text-Append-Next`, which contains the entire URL to pass to the `GET` method to return the changes since the last call. You can use this header in client applications to get all log entries that were added in particular interval.

For example, by testing the value of the `X-Text-Append-Next` header in a client thread every 10 seconds, you can monitor the log entries that were added in the last 10 seconds.

[[using-rest-resource-methods-to-administer-payara-server]]
=== Using REST Resource Methods to Administer Payara Server

The Payara Server REST interfaces support methods for accessing objects in the monitoring and configuration object trees.

The following table shows the REST methods for administering monitoring and configuration data and the tasks that you can perform with each method. These methods are HTTP 1.1 primitives.

.Table 2-1 REST Resource Methods for Administering Monitoring and Configuration Data
[header, cols="4,5"]
|===
|Task |REST Method

|Determine the methods and method parameters that an object in the tree supports
|`GET`

|Retrieve data for an object in the tree
|`GET`

|Add an object to the tree
|`POST`

|Update an object in the tree
|`POST`

|Delete an object from the tree
|`DELETE`

|===

NOTE: REST requests that add, update, or delete objects must specify the `X-Requested-By` header with the value `GlassFish REST HTML interface`.

The `GET` method determines the methods and method parameters that an object in the tree supports and provides additional information about the object. For details, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/general-administration.adoc#to-retrieve-data-for-an-object-in-the-tree[To Retrieve Data for an Object in the Tree].

[[to-determine-the-methods-and-method-parameters-that-an-object-in-the-tree-supports]]
=== To Determine the Methods and Method Parameters That an Object in the Tree Supports

The methods and method parameters that an object in the tree supports depend on the REST resource that represents the object:

* REST resources for monitoring support only the `GET` method.
* All REST resources for configuration support the `GET` method. However, only some REST resources for configuration also support the `POST` method and the `DELETE` method.

Before performing any operations on an object in the tree, determine the methods and method parameters that the object supports.

You can specify the format in which this information is presented. For more information,
see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/general-administration.adoc#formats-for-resource-representation-of-configuration-objects[Formats for Resource Representation of Configuration Objects].


NOTE: Each `POST` method and `DELETE` method that a REST resource supports has an equivalent `asadmin` subcommand. The parameters of a `POST` method or a `DELETE` method correspond to the options of the method's equivalent `asadmin` subcommand.

. Ensure that the server is running. Operations on REST resources for Payara Server data require a running server.
. Use the `GET` method on the REST resource that represents the object. The `GET` method returns the list of methods that the resource supports.
For each method, the list of acceptable message parameters or the list of acceptable query parameters are returned.

==== Example 2-29 Determining the Methods and Method Parameters That an Object in the Tree Supports

This example uses the cURL utility to determine the methods and method parameters that the resource for the node `sj01` supports.
The example uses the following options of the cURL utility:

* `-X` to specify that the `GET` method is used
* `-H` to specify that the resource is represented in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

In this example, the DAS is running on the local host and the HTTP port for administration is 4848. The resource supports the `GET` method and the `POST` method.

[[resources-for-asadmin-subcommands-that-perform-non-crud-operations]]
=== Resources for `asadmin` Subcommands That Perform Non-CRUD Operations

The Payara Server REST interfaces also support operations other than create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, for example:

* State Management
* Queries
* Application deployment

These operations are supported through REST resources that represent the `asadmin` subcommands for performing these operations. Each resource is a child of the resource on which the operation is performed. The child resources do not represent objects in the configuration object tree.

For example, the resource that represents a node provides child resources for the following `asadmin` subcommands that perform non-CRUD operations on the node:

* `ping-node-ssh`
* `update-node-config`
* `update-node-ssh`

[[securing-payara-server-rest-interfaces]]
=== Securing Payara Server REST Interfaces

The Payara Server REST interfaces support the following authentication schemes for securing the REST interfaces:

* Basic authentication over a secure connection
* Authentication by using session tokens

When security is enabled, you must specify `https` as the protocol in the URLs to REST resources and provide a user name and password.

[[setting-up-basic-authentication-over-a-secure-connection]]
==== *Setting Up Basic Authentication Over a Secure Connection*

Setting up basic authentication over a secure connection to secure Payara Server REST interfaces involves the following sequence of tasks:

. Adding an `admin-realm` user to the `asadmin` user group
. Enabling Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

For information about how to perform these tasks from the command line, see the following documentation:

* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Security Guide/user-security.adoc#to-create-an-authentication-realm[To Create an Authentication Realm] in Payara Server Security Guide
* xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Security Guide/user-security.adoc#to-create-a-file-user[To Create a File User] in Payara Server  Security Guide
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/http_https.adoc#to-configure-an-http-listener-for-ssl[To Configure an HTTP Listener for SSL]

For information about how to perform these tasks by using the Administration Console, see the following topics in the Administration Console online help:

* To Add a User to the Admin Realm
* To Edit SSL Settings for a Protocol

[[to-secure-rest-interfaces-by-using-session-tokens]]
==== *To Secure REST Interfaces by Using Session Tokens*

Basic authentication requires a REST client to cache a user's credentials to enable the client to pass the credentials with each request. If you require a REST client not to cache credentials, your client must use session tokens for authentication.

. Request a session token by using the `GET` method on the resource at `http://`host:port/management/sessions`.
+
Payara Server uses basic authentication to authenticate the client, generates a session token, and passes the token to the client.
. In each subsequent request that requires authentication, use the token to authenticate the client.
. Create a cookie that is named `gfresttoken` the value of which is the token.
. Send the cookie with the request.
. When the token is no longer required, retire the token by using the `DELETE` method on the resource at `http://host:port/management/sessions/{tokenvalue}`.

CAUTION: If a client does not explicitly retire a token, the token is retired after 30 minutes of inactivity.

[[formats-for-resource-representation-of-configuration-objects]]
=== Formats for Resource Representation of Configuration Objects

The Payara Server REST interfaces represent resources for configuration objects in the following formats:

* http://www.json.org/[JSON]
* XML
* HTML

Payara Server enables you to specify the resource representation through the filename extension in the URL or through the HTTP header:

* To specify the resource representation through the filename extension in the URL, specify the appropriate extension as follows:

** For JSON, specify the `.json` extension.
** For XML, specify the `.xml` extension.
** For HTML, omit the extension.

* How to specify the resource representation through the HTTP header depends on the client that you are using to access the resource. For example, if you are using the cURL utility, specify the resource representation through the `-H` option as follows:

** For JSON, specify `-H "Accept: application/json"`.
** For XML, specify `-H "Accept: application/xml"`.
** For HTML, omit the `-H` option.

==== *XML Resource Representation for Log File Details*

The general format for the XML representation of a resource for log file details is as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<records>
 records
</records>
----

The replaceable item in this format is the records, which is one or more XML elements that represent the log records in the log file. For the format of each element, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/general-administration.adoc#xml-representation-of-a-log-record[XML Representation of a Log Record].

[[xml-representation-of-a-log-record]]
==== *XML Representation of a Log Record*

The XML representation of a log record is as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<record loggedDateTimeInMS="logged-date" loggedLevel="log-level" loggerName="logger-class-name" messageID="message-id" nameValuePairs="_ThreadID=thread-id;_thread-name;" productName="product-name" recordNumber="record-number"/>
----

The replaceable items in this format are as follows:

logged-date::
  The date and time in UNIX time that the record was created.
log-level::
  The severity level of the message in the log record. For more information, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/logging.adoc#setting-log-levels[Setting Log Levels].
logger-class-name::
  The fully qualified name of the Java class of the logger class that created the log message. Each component of Payara Server provides its own logger class.
  For detailed information about the names of logger classes in Payara Server, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/logging.adoc#logger-namespaces[Logger Namespaces].
message-id::
  A unique identifier for the message. For messages from Payara Server, this identifier consists of a module code and a numerical value,
  for example, `CORE5004`. All `SEVERE` and `WARNING` messages and some `INFO` messages from Payara Server contain a message identifier.
thread-id::
  The numerical identifier of the thread that created the message.
thread-name::
  The name of the thread that created the message.
product-name::
  The current name and version of the server runtime.
record-number::
  A serial number in the form of a decimal integer that uniquely identifies the log record.

[[supported-content-types-in-requests-to-rest-resources]]
==== *Supported Content Types in Requests to REST Resources*

The Payara Server REST interfaces support the following types in the content-type header of a client request:

* http://www.json.org/[JSON]
* XML
* http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1[Form URL encoded]

How to specify the type in the content-type header depends on how you are sending the request. For example, if you are using the cURL utility, specify the type through the `-H` option as follows:

* For JSON, specify `-H "Content-type: application/json"`.
* For XML, specify `-H "Content-type: application/xml"`.
* For form URL encoded, specify `-H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`.

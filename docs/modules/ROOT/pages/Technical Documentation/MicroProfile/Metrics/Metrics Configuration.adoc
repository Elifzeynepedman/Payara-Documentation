[[security-configuration]]
=== Security Configuration
By default, the OpenAPI endpoint binds to the root context application which is the `__default-web-module` (also known as *docroot*) system application and the `__default-web-module` application, which is secured under the default realm (`file`) of the server. 

If a user application is deployed in the empty context-root, then the security configuration of this application will be shared by the OpenAPI endpoint, so exert extreme caution when making these changes.

= Payara Server Domain Backup

Oracle GlassFish 3.1.x had a built-in automatic backup facility using the `asadmin`
command `create-backup-config`. This allowed you to specify a schedule for when
to backup, where to place the backed up file, and how many backups to keep.

This is no longer present in GlassFish Server 4.1.x or Payara Server, since it was a
commercial feature that was never open-sourced, but its effects can be reproduced
without much effort using the `backup-domain` command and some scheduling
software (_crontab_, for example)

Since the domain directory is where all of the user configuration of Payara
Server Community is kept, we can consider this to be separate to the installation files
that Payara Server uses to run the app server itself. We can backup the domain
using the `asadmin backup-domain` command as follows:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> backup-domain --backupDir /path/to/backup/directory myDomain
----

The effect of this command is to create a full backup of the domain directory.
To complete the command, however, *the domain must be stopped first*.
This will mean that any application deployed to the DAS is unavailable while
the backup takes place.

The resulting ZIP file will be saved in a destination with this structure:

----
<backupDir>/<domain-name>/<domain-name>_<yyyy_mm_dd>_v<backup_number>
----

Where the *backup number* is a consecutive integer representing how many backups
of the domain have been made.

The job of running this backup command on a given schedule and managing the
resulting backed up files needs to be done by a script external to Payara
Server Community.

You can get more details of the backup operation by using the `--long` argument
when running the command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > backup-domain --backupDir /opt/backups/ --long domain1

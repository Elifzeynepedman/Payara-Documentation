[[what-is-a-connection-pool]]
== What is a connection pool?

Database connections are expensive to create and maintain. A connection
pool is a store of database connections that can be used and (more importantly)
re-used to connect to a RDBMS database. They help to improve both the performance
and scalability of the system.

Rather than creating a new connection each time one is needed a pool of logical
connections is created when Payara Server is started. When a new connection is
required the pool is searched for an available connection. If one is available
it is returned to the requester. If none is available then the request is either
queued or a new connection is established depending on how many connections
are already in the pool and how the pool is configured.

Once the connection is finished with, rather than closing it the connection is
returned to the connection pool for use by the next requester.

== Creating a connection pool

It is possible to create a JDBC connection pool on the web administration console,
or using administration commands.

[[using-admin-console]]
=== Using Admin Console

In the left hand panel of the Admin console go to _Resources_ -> _JDBC_ -> _JDBC Connection Pools_

Click the _New_ button and enter the following values:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting Name |Value
|Pool Name |test-pool
|Resource Type |javax.sql.DataSource
|Driver Vendor |(value for the driver, e.g. Derby30 for a Derby DB, MySQL for a MySQL DB)
|=======================================================================

Click Next and then click Finish on the next screen, accepting the default values.

Add the following properties to the connection pool by going to the _Additional Properties_
tab of the connection pool:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting name |Value |Description
|PortNumber |3306 |Database port
|Password |mypassword |Database password
|User |root |Database user
|serverName |localhost |Database address
|DatabaseName |test |Name of the database
|connectionAttributes | |Other connection attributes (supported by the JDBC driver)
|=======================================================================

To test the connection attributes, go back to the _General_ tab and click the
_Ping_ button at the top of the screen. You should see a message stating that the
ping succeeded.

[[using-asadmin]]
=== Using administration commands

You can also create a JDBC connection pool using the `asadmin` command line tool
with the following options:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> create-jdbc-connection-pool --datasourceclassname com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource --restype javax.sql.DataSource --property user=root:password=test:DatabaseName=test:ServerName=localhost:port=3306 test-pool
----

With this command, you need to specify the full name of the driver's class
instead of just selecting a value from a drop-down menu.

You can test the connection to the database from the command line run the
following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> ping-connection-pool test-pool
----

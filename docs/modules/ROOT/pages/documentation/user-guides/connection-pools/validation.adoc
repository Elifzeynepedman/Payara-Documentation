[[connection-validation]]
= Connection validation

Connection validation ensures that connections aren't assigned to your application
after the connection has already gone stale.

Connection validation is always a trade-off between how sure you want to be that
a connection is valid and the performance impact that the validation mechanism can
exert into application that use the pool. There will be a negative performance
impact by having to return an invalid connection by your application and borrow
a new one, so finding the right balance is key.

Before using a connection from the pool a simple query is sent to test the
connection. If there is an issue with the connection, it is removed from the pool
and another one is used. If you have an issue such as the database being down
and you have a large number of connections then each of those connections will
be tested and removed.

In order to avoid this, you can set a connection validation so that if a connection
fails, all remaining open connections are closed.

[[set-up-the-validation-via-the-admin-console]]
== Set up the validation using the admin console

. Click on the name of the connection pool
. Select the _Advanced_ tab
. Scroll down to the _Connection Validation_ section and select the following
settings:
.. _Connection Validation required_
.. _Validation method_ - custom-validation
.. _Validation class name_ â€“ a proper class name for the chosen JDBC driver,
such as `org.glassfish.api.jdbc.validation.DerbyConnectionValidation` for a
*Derby DB*

From the same screen, you can also set whether to close all connections on
failure.

[[set-up-the-validation-using-asadmin]]
== Set up the validation using administration commands

To turn on connection validation using `asadmin` commands:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.connection-validation-method=custom-validation
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.validation-classname= org.glassfish.api.jdbc.validation.DerbyConnectionValidation
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.is-connection-validation-required=true
----

You can also set whether to close all connections on failure with the
following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.fail-all-connections=true
----

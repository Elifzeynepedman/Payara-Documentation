= Statement and Connection Leak Detection

This feature allows you to set specific time-outs so that if SQL statements or
JDBC connections haven't been closed by an application (potentially leading to a
memory leak) they can be logged and/or closed.

By default these values are set to *0* meaning this detection feature is turned off.

TIP: When working on a test or staging environment, it is recommended that
leaks are logged after a short timeout but not closed. On production environments,
it is recommended that leaks are closed and all logged leaks are monitored instead.

== Configuring Leak Detection using administration commands

You also can set the time-out values using the following `asadmin` commands:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.statement-leak-timeout-in-seconds=5
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.test-pool.connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds=5
----

You can turn on reclaiming of the leaking resources with the following commands:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.DerbyPool.connection-leak-reclaim=true
asadmin> setresources.jdbc-connection-pool.DerbyPool.statement-leak-reclaim=true
----

Once these values are set, if connection or statement leaks are detected, you
will see messages similar to the example below in the application log:

[source, log]
----
WARNING: A potential connection leak detected for connection pool test-pool. The stack trace of the thread is provided below:

= Upgrading Payara Server

There are two valid methods of fully upgrading to a new release of Payara
Server Community. Either of the following two methods would work in most circumstances:

. Backing up and restoring the existing configuration to a new installation.
. Maintaining completely separate domain and node directories and pointing
the new version to the existing directories.

[[method-1-backup-and-restore]]
== Method 1: Backup and Restore

This method involves the following steps:

. Stop the running domain
+
WARNING: The asadmin `backup-domain` subcommand will only work if the domain is
not running so, if this method is chosen for a production system, there would
need to be an arranged period of downtime.

. Run `asadmin backup-domain` from the existing Payara Server Community installation
. Once the domain has been backed up, restore the domain to the newly
downloaded Payara Server Community installation by running `asadmin restore-domain`
from the bin directory of the new Payara Server Community installation

After following these steps, you should be left with a similar directory
structure to the following:

----
/opt/payara/161/payara41/glassfish/domains/myDomain
/opt/payara/162/payara41/glassfish/domains/myDomain
/opt/payara/backups/myDomain/myDomain_2016_05_27_v00001.zip
----

This method only backs up the domain directory and its contents.
Any instances you have in node directories will need to regenerated by using
the `--sync=full` option of the start-local-instance subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin start-local-instance --sync=full myInstance
----

This will recreate the instance from scratch. Be aware, though, that this
will *not* recreate things stored in the instance directory which are outside
of the configuration like JMS file stores. If there is any JMS persistence
which does not use a database, these must be handled manually.

See xref:documentation/user-guides/restore-domain.adoc[Restore a Payara Domain] for more detail.

[[method-2-move-the-domain-directory-and-node-directories]]
== Method 2: Move the domain directory and node directories

An alternative to backing up and restoring the domain, then recreating the
instances, would be to create the domain and node directories in a location
separate to the installation. For example, if you download _Payara Server 4.1.1.154_,
created a domain, and then wanted to use _Payara Server 4.1.1.162_, you would
use the following process:

[source, shell]
----
/opt/payara/payara-4.1.154/payara41 bin/asadmin create-domain --domaindir /tmp myTempDomain
/opt/payara/payara-4.1.154/payara41 cd ../../payara-4.1.162/payara41
/opt/payara/payara-4.1.162/payara41 bin/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /tmp myTempDomain
----

This will use the _4.1.1.154_ installation to create a new domain, and then run
it with the _4.1.1.162_ installation.

You can do the same thing with nodes too:

[source, shell]
----
/opt/payara/payara-4.1.154/payara41 bin/asadmin create-node --nodedir /tmp myLocalNode
----

In this way, the user configuration is always kept separate to the installation,
and rollback is as simple as using the previous installation directory.

If you are using Payara Server Community on Linux, you could take advantage of _"symbolic links"_
to make life easier. When your domain directory is in a non-standard
location, it means that you need to specify its location with each
`start`/`stop`/`restart` command. If you were to create a symbolic link to
the domain directory inside the default domains directory, then all of your
existing scripts will carry on as normal.

You could even extend this further to create a symbolic link to whichever
Payara Server installation was currently used in production, for example:

----
/opt/payara/live/payara41/....
----

This means that any rollback is as simple as stopping the server, updating
a symbolic link and starting it again.

Without the use of symbolic links, things get a bit more manual (though still
quite straightforward). The asadmin start-domain subcommand has a
`--domaindir` option which allows you to specify the location of a domain
directory. So you could have a directory structure like this:

----
/opt/payara/154/payara41/....
/opt/payara/161/payara41/....
/opt/payara/162/payara41/....
/opt/payara/domains/myDomain
/opt/payara/nodes/myLocalNode
----

Then you could start your domain with whatever version of Payara Server you
wanted:

[source, shell]
----
/opt/payara/154/payara41/bin/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /opt/payara/domains myDomain
----

...or like this:

[source, shell]
----
/opt/payara/162/payara41/bin/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /opt/payara/domains myDomain
----

NOTE: The `--domaindir` option specifies the parent directory for your
domain and where you would store all of your domains if needed. 

You can also start nodes in the same way:

[source, shell]
----
/opt/payara/162/payara41/bin/asadmin start-local-instance --nodedir /opt/payara/nodes myLocalNode
----

[[jdk-11-upgrade-considerations]]
== JDK 11: Upgrade considerations

From Payara Server 5.192 onwards `domain.xml` contains instructions for handling JDK 11. Without these instructions, Payara will not start up on JDK 11 and/or will throw many exceptions during runtime.

If older, pre-5.192, domains are being migrated this has to be taken into account. The following `jvm-options` have to be added to the `java-config` element in `domain.xml`:

```xml
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.loader=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>      
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]--add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.jrt=ALL-UNNAMED</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>[9|]-Xbootclasspath/a:${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/grizzly-npn-api.jar</jvm-options>
```

The following `jvm-options` have to be removed:

```xml
    <jvm-options>-Djava.endorsed.dirs=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/modules/endorsed${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/endorsed</jvm-options>
    <jvm-options>-Djava.ext.dirs=${com.sun.aas.javaRoot}/lib/ext${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.javaRoot}/jre/lib/ext${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/lib/ext</jvm-options>
```

Note that in Payara 5.192 support for JDK 11 is limited to a *_technical preview_*.

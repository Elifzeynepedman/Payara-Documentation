= Monitoring Payara Server

Monitoring is critically important for successfully running any online presence
for many reasons. There are a large number of solutions for monitoring which
can address these needs, from Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools,
which can help diagnose the health of an application to more traditional
infrastructure monitoring tools.

For Java applications, Java Management Extensions (JMX) has been an accepted
standard for publishing metrics for a very long time. Since JMX has been around
for so long, there is very wide support in tooling. Despite being widely
available, however, JMX has not always been very widely used. Because of this,
it is not always obvious or straightforward to consume JMX metrics with a given
tool.

These guides aim to give an overview of monitoring Payara Server Community with JMX. As 
new guides get added, this section will include:

xref:documentation/user-guides/monitoring/enable-jmx-monitoring.adoc[How do I enable JMX monitoring in Payara Server?]::
Before anything else, we need to know how to enable JMX monitoring and get
familiarised with the concepts involved.
xref:documentation/user-guides/monitoring/mbeans.adoc[What MBean metrics should I monitor?]::
Once monitoring data is enabled through JMX in Payara Server Community, the next important
step is to understand which MBeans are most important, and which metrics from
each MBean can give the most useful information.
How can I consume JMX monitoring data from Payara Server?::
After a selection of relevant metrics have been chosen, they will need to be
imported to a monitoring tool for graphing purposes.

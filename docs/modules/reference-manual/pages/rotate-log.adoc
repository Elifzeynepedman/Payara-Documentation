[[description]]
== Description

The `rotate-log` subcommand rotates the server log by renaming the file with a timestamp name in the format `server.log_`date-and-time, and creating a new log file. Changes take effect dynamically, that is,server restart is not required.

The size of the log queue is configurable through the `logging.properties` file. Log rotation is based on file size or elapsed time since the last log rotation. In some circumstances, the queue might fill up, especially if the log level is set to `FINEST` and there is heavy activity on the server. In this case, the `rotate-log` subcommand can be used to rotate the server log immediately. This subcommand is also useful in creating scripts for rotating the log at convenient times.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

= Payara Platform Documentation Repository

Official technical documentation repository of the Payara Platform. All documentation material is written in Asciidoctor format.

This branch is *used exclusively* to host the release notes of Payara Enterprise Platform patches for version `4.1.2.x` and it *should not be used to generate the documentation sites for this version*, as this branch will be adapted for future content generation.

TODO:

* Move remaining `4.1.x.y` version patch notes to this branch.
* Restructure this branch to generate documentation for Payara Server `4.1.2.191.x`

== Security Vulnerability
IMPORTANT: We have been made aware of a 0-day vulnerability. This vulnerability exploit opens up to attackers a way to explore the contents of the WEB-INF and META-INF folders if an application is deployed to the root context. This vulnerability is similar to another 0-day vulnerability (CVE-2022-37422) we recently had. We would like to thank Michael Baer, Luc Cr√©ti and Jean-Michel Lenotte, all working for Atos, for alerting us to this vulnerability. You must upgrade to this latest version of Payara 6 Community to avoid the security issue.
